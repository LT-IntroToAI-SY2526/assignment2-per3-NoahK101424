# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
The most difficult part for me was writing the code if the current thing in the pattern is a %. This part was especially dificult for me because it used many new python terms and functions that I did not know of before, making me really struggle to solve the roblem on my own. for example, the .join() or .strip() methods, which were used in the solution, I did not know of before. 


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
I could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database by find if a list of movies that I created (pattern) matches with the movies that are in its database (source). For example, if I had a list of movies [x, y, z], I could check if the movie database matches my list. Additionally, I can use "_" and "%" to find specific movies within the movie database.
